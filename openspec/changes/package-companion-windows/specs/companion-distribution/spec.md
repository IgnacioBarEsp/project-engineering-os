## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Verifiable Windows artifact
The app SHALL be distributed as a Windows x64 installer whose contents are verified before publication
against an explicit allowlist, and whose identity, checksum, licenses and real signing status are published
with it. It SHALL NOT suppress or work around an operating-system warning.

#### Scenario: Artifact is produced
- **WHEN** the packaging script builds the installer from a clean checkout
- **THEN** verification lists the packaged files, the pinned core version and the included licenses
- **AND** an unexpected file, a development dependency or a missing license stops publication

#### Scenario: Signing status is reported
- **WHEN** no code-signing certificate is available
- **THEN** the published identity states that the artifact is unsigned and that Windows will warn
- **AND** no claim of a verified publisher, reputation or silent installation is made

### Requirement: Installation that preserves the person's work
Installation SHALL be per-user, offer a destination and a shortcut, and present the license and data
notice before writing. Uninstallation SHALL remove only what the installer wrote.

#### Scenario: A person installs and launches the app
- **WHEN** the installer runs on a Windows machine without Node or a terminal
- **THEN** the app starts from its shortcut and reaches its first screen

#### Scenario: A person reinstalls or uninstalls
- **WHEN** the app is reinstalled over an existing installation or removed
- **THEN** prepared project folders, the local project history and the managed runtimes remain intact
- **AND** removing those runtimes or that history is an explicit separate action
